# Privacy Policy for স্বাধীন এআই (Shadhin AI)

**Last Updated:** September 9, 2025

Welcome to স্বাধীন এআই ("we," "our," or "us"). Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy is designed to be simple and clear: we do not collect your personal data on our server.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

Our application does not include a login or registration system. We do not ask for, collect, or store any personally identifiable information on our servers, such as your name, email address, phone number, or location. You can use our app completely anonymously.

### User-Provided Information for Personalization

To enhance your experience and provide more personalized AI responses, you have the option to provide:
-   **Nickname:** A chosen name to address you.
-   **Self-Description:** A brief description about yourself (up to 100 characters).

This information is **stored exclusively on your local device**. We do not collect or store this data on our servers. However, if you choose to use this information for personalized AI responses, it will be included as part of the prompt sent to Google's Gemini API. It is used solely within the app to tailor AI interactions.

### Chat History

Your chat conversations are **stored locally on your device only**. We do not collect, store, or have access to your chat history. This ensures your conversations remain private and under your control.

## 2. Information You Provide

To use the core features of our AI assistant, you can provide text prompts and images. Here’s how that content is handled:

-   **Text and Image Prompts:** The questions, prompts, and images you submit are sent directly to a third-party AI service (Google's Gemini API) to generate a response. This is essential for the app to function.
-   **We Do Not Store Your Content:** We do not save or keep any record of your conversations, prompts, or the images you upload on our servers. Your interaction history is stored only on your own device.

## 3. Third-Party AI Service (Google Gemini)

While we do not collect or store your personal data or chat history, the text prompts and images you submit for AI responses are sent directly to Google's Gemini API. This is solely for the purpose of generating AI responses and is essential for the app's functionality. We encourage you to review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to understand how they handle data.

## 4. Permissions

Our app requests the following permissions to enable its features:

-   **`INTERNET`**: Required to communicate with the AI service.
-   **`CAMERA`**: Optional, allows you to take a photo to use as a prompt.
-   **`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`**: Optional, allows you to select an existing image from your gallery to use as a prompt.

We do not access your camera or gallery unless you specifically choose to use these features within the app.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we ever change our data practices (for example, by adding new features that require data), we will update this policy and notify you.
