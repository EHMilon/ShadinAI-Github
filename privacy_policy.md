# Privacy Policy for স্বাধীন এআই (Shadhin AI)

**Last Updated:** August 22, 2025

Welcome to স্বাধীন এআই ("we," "our," or "us"). Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy is designed to be simple and clear: we do not collect your personal data.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

Our application does not include a login or registration system. We do not ask for, collect, or store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location. You can use our app completely anonymously.

## 2. Information You Provide

To use the core features of our AI assistant, you can provide text prompts and images. Here’s how that content is handled:

-   **Text and Image Prompts:** The questions, prompts, and images you submit are sent directly to a third-party AI service (Google's Gemini API) to generate a response. This is essential for the app to function.
-   **We Do Not Store Your Content:** We do not save or keep any record of your conversations, prompts, or the images you upload on our servers. Your interaction history is stored only on your own device.

## 3. Third-Party AI Service (Google Gemini)

While we do not store your data, the content you submit is processed by Google. We encourage you to review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to understand how they handle data.

## 4. Permissions

Our app requests the following permissions to enable its features:

-   **`INTERNET`**: Required to communicate with the AI service.
-   **`CAMERA`**: Optional, allows you to take a photo to use as a prompt.
-   **`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`**: Optional, allows you to select an existing image from your gallery to use as a prompt.

We do not access your camera or gallery unless you specifically choose to use these features within the app.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we ever change our data practices (for example, by adding new features that require data), we will update this policy and notify you.
